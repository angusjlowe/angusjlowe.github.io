I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/">Center for Theoretical Physics</a> at MIT. My primary interests lie in quantum computation, quantum complexity, and learning theory.

Before MIT, I completed a BSc in physics and computer science at the University of Edinburgh and an MMATH at the University of Waterloo. Apart from my research I enjoy playing basketball, practicing saxophone, and travelling whenever I can.
