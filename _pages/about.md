I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/">Center for Theoretical Physics</a> at MIT. My primary interests lie in quantum information and related areas, particularly quantum algorithms, learning properties of quantum states, and complexity.

Apart from research I enjoy playing basketball, skiing, and
